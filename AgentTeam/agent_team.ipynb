    "\n",
    "Let's begin by building the fundamental component of our Weather Bot: a single agent capable of performing a specific task – looking up weather information. This involves creating two core pieces:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Tool: A Python function that equips the agent with the ability to fetch weather data.\n",
    "An Agent: The AI \"brain\" that understands the user's request, knows it has a weather tool, and decides when and how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the Tool (get_weather)\n",
    "\n",
    "In ADK, Tools are the building blocks that give agents concrete capabilities beyond just text generation. They are typically regular Python functions that perform specific actions, like calling an API, querying a database, or performing calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first tool will provide a mock weather report. This allows us to focus on the agent structure without needing external API keys yet. Later, you could easily swap this mock function with one that calls a real weather service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concept: Docstrings are Crucial! The agent's LLM relies heavily on the function's docstring to understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "What the tool does.\n",
    "When to use it.\n",
    "What arguments it requires (city: str).\n",
    "What information it returns.\n",
    "Best Practice: Write clear, descriptive, and accurate docstrings for your tools. This is essential for the LLM to use the tool correctly.\n"
